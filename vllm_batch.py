In recent times, allegations have surfaced regarding cooperation between some UNRWA employees and Hamas during rounds of fighting in Gaza. Consequently, American aid to UNRWA has been stopped.
Your task is to classify tweets from members of the American Congress regarding the cessation of aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) into one of the following categories:
Each time a tweet is provided, I will respond with the corresponding category number it belongs to.
Class 0: Tweets not related to UNRWA funding.
- Tweets mentioning UNRWA or Gaza without discussing the halt of UNRWA funding
-Tweets that talk about hunger or a difficult humanitarian situation and do not specifically mention UNRWA
-Tweets that talk about a certain budget or funding but do not talk about the organization UNRA

Class 1: Tweets expressing opposition to UNRWA and advocating for ending funding.
- Tweets condemning UNRWA and supporting the cessation of aid, citing concerns over alleged connections with Hamas.
- Statements welcoming the halt in aid as necessary to prevent support for alleged terrorist activities.

Class 2: Tweets mentioning the decision to halt funding for UNRWA, without expressing a specific opinion.
- Tweets discussing the cessation of aid to UNRWA without firmly taking a stance either in favor or against it.
- Comments acknowledging the cessation of aid to UNRWA but not providing a clear opinion on whether it should be supported or opposed.

Class 3: Tweets in favor of UNRWA and advocating for continued funding.
- Tweets supporting UNRWA and opposing the cessation of aid, emphasizing the importance of its humanitarian efforts.
- Statements advocating for the restoration of funding to UNRWA to ensure continued support for Palestinians.

Examples of tweets and the classification that suits them:

"Trump halted ALL funding to the UNRWA. 
Biden immediately restored funding and has paid over a BILLION DOLLARS to the Hamas supporters since taking office. 
It‚Äôs estimated that nearly half of all UNRWA employees have ties to Hamas and other terrorist groups. 
UNACCEPTABLE.‚Ä¶"
ANSWER 1:

"The United States should not have given one dollar to the antisemitic @UNRWA. 
According to a new report, approximately 1,200 staff members have ties to Hamas or other terrorist organizations."
ANSWER 1:

"I joined Sen. @MarshaBlackburn in introducing legislation after October 7 to block American taxpayer dollars going to the UNRWA, because the U.S. has a national security imperative to ensure that not a single cent of our money enables Hamas.
What took the Biden Admin this long?"
ANSWER 1:

"As the largest humanitarian organisation in the #GazaStrip - we will do whatever possible to continue our indispensable work to support the people of üìç#Gaza 
At this critical moment #DonateToUNRWA: https://t.co/BAncZ2TnRb https://t.co/tY6VQrdsHM"
ANSWER 3:

"Cutting off support to @UNRWA - the primary source of humanitarian aid to 2 million+ Gazans - is unacceptable.
Among an organization of 13,000 UN aid workers, risking the starvation of millions over grave allegations of 12 is indefensible.
The US should restore aid immediately."
ANSWER 3:

"Yesterday, I met with the leaders of several major humanitarian NGOs who just returned from travel to Gaza. I remain concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and I'll keep working for lifesaving aid for Gazan civilians. https://t.co/krJHGXh5ne"
ANSWER 0: 

"Sitting Israeli officials spoke at a conference to recolonize Gaza, calling for the expulsion of Palestinians to build new Israeli settlements. The U.S. cannot continue to be complicit in ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. President Biden must stop funding it."
ANSWER 0:

"Gaza is starving. I spoke with @WFPChiefEcon Arif Husain and the bottom line is this: If we do not see a dramatic improvement in humanitarian access very soon, countless more innocent people ‚Äì including thousands of children ‚Äì could die. The U.S. must act. https://t.co/mIqKmAE8Hd"
ANSWER 0:


"Great point from @RepMikeRogersAL.
We need a FULL accounting of exactly where US taxpayer dollars are going after they are spent by the UN AND whether any US dollars were WRONGFULLY used to perpetrate the terrorist attack on Oct. 7th."

houthis_prompt = '''
In recent weeks, Yemeni Houthi militants, which are backed by the iranian regime, have repeatedly targeted and attacked U.S. personnel, military bases, and commercial vessels in the Red Sea, resulting in significant disruptions to maritime traffic and raising concerns about regional stability and security. As a response, the U.S., in collaboration with several other countries, has initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian to collectively address security challenges in the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, with the primary goal of ensuring the freedom of navigation in the area. On January 12, 2024, U.S. and U.K. forces conducted multiple airstrikes against Houthi targets as part of this operation.

According to Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims, the director of the US military's Joint Staff, the initial strikes on January 12 successfully achieved their objective of damaging the Houthis' ability to launch complex drone and missile attacks similar to the ones they conducted earlier. However, despite causing significant damage to Houthi capabilities, subsequent assessments indicated that the strikes did not entirely deter further attacks on shipping in the region. Yemeni sources reported casualties among Houthi fighters, including members of Hezbollah, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, and Iraqi militants.

Reactions to these military actions have been varied. Domestically, the Yemeni government strongly condemned the Houthi attacks and affirmed its right to enhance security in the Red Sea region. On the other hand, Houthi officials labeled the airstrikes as blatant aggression and vowed retaliation. Massive protests erupted in Houthi-controlled cities denouncing the U.S. and British military actions.

Internationally, responses ranged from expressions of support to condemnation. While some countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., justified the strikes as necessary for safeguarding maritime navigation and addressing security threats, others, such as Iran and Syria, condemned them as violations of Yemen's sovereignty and international law. Notably, China urged restraint and highlighted the need to avoid further escalation in the region.

Given these developments and the diverse range of reactions, your task is to classify tweets related to American strikes against the Houthis into one of the following categories: Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, Class 4, Class 5, or Class 0. Below, we provide clear and detailed guidance for each class based on the spectrum of opinions and reactions observed.

Class 1: Supportive of U.S. actions against the Houthis.

Tweets that endorse U.S. and coalition operations against the Houthis, emphasizing the need for repercussions for Houthi aggression.
Statements welcoming military actions as necessary and overdue, highlighting the Biden administration's warnings to the Houthis.
Expressions of support for attacking the Houthis in response to their actions, linking it to national security concerns.
Pay attention, tweets with minor criticism of the Biden administration, as long as they primarily endorse the military actions against the Houthis, should still be classified under Class 1.
If the tweet explicitly endorses targeting Tehran as a response to Iranian support for militant groups or aggression against U.S. interests or allies, it should be classified as Class 1.
Class 2: Expressing a nuanced view on the American attacks against the Houthis.

Tweets presenting mixed opinions on U.S. attacks in Yemen on the Houthis, acknowledging both positive and negative aspects without firmly aligning with either support or objection.
Pay attention, if the tweet primarily expresses support for the strike and emphasizes the importance of taking action against the Houthi aggression, while also containing elements of critique towards the Biden administration's handling of the situation in a manner that does not include constitutional concerns, regional stability concerns, or isolationist views, should be classified under Class 1, as long as the overall tone of the tweet leans more towards endorsing the military actions.
Class 3: Objecting to military operations against the Houthis due to potential escalation of violence.

Tweets expressing concerns about the consequences of military operations against the Houthis, including escalation of violence and destabilization of the region.
Statements criticizing airstrikes against the Houthis as violating international law or sovereignty, with a focus on promoting peace and stability.
Tweets expressing concerns about the effectiveness of military actions in Yemen against the Houthis and advocating for alternative, non-violent approaches to conflict resolution.
Class 4: Opposing the attacks against the Houthis because of opposing any U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts, reflecting isolationist views.

Tweets condemning U.S. attacks against the Houthis because of objection to U.S. involvement in foreign wars and advocating for prioritizing domestic affairs over military engagements.
You will be classified in this category only if the tweet talks about it in the context of the Houthis or the attacks in Yemen. If it is talking about other places, do not classify as this category.
Class 5: Opposing the American attacks on the Houthis, citing constitutional concerns.

Tweets explicitly condemning U.S. airstrikes against the Houthis as unconstitutional due to lack of congressional approval.
Statements asserting that only Congress has the authority to declare war and criticizing the Biden administration for bypassing this process in the Houthi subject.
Expressions of reluctance to support broader military involvement in Yemen without clear congressional authorization and debate.

Class 0: Unopinionated tweets or tweets that are not related to the american houthi conflict
Tweets that do not express any opinion on the houthi american situation and the american attacks on the houthi rebeles.
Include tweets that are not related to the houthies and their actiones.
expressions that are related to different conflicts apart from the houthies will also be included in class 0.
Pay attention, tweets that mention the need to release all hostages and the war in Gaza without mentioning Houthi attacks in the Red Sea should be classified under class 0.
Pay attention, if the tweet contains the words "Houthis," "Red Sea," "Iranian proxies," and such, it should be classified under class 0 if it does not express an opinion regarding the Houthi attacks or the American attacks. If a tweet contains those words without expressing an opinion, it should be classified under class 0.
- Tweets that only focus on the south U.S border immigrants issue - class 0
- Tweets that only focus on U.S economy or internal issues - class 0
- Very short tweets (1-3 words) - class 0


Examples:
Tweet: "This action by U.S. and British forces is long overdue, and we must hope these
		operations indicate a true shift in the Biden Administration‚Äôs approach to Iran and its
		proxies that are engaging in such evil and wreaking such havoc. They must
		understand there is a serious price to pay for their global acts of terror and their
		attacks on U.S. personnel and commercial vessels. America must always project
		strength, especially in these dangerous times."
ANSWER: 1

Tweet: "I welcome the U.S. and coalition operations against the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists
		responsible for violently disrupting international commerce in the Red Sea and
		attacking American vessels. President Biden‚Äôs decision to use military force against

		aggression are over."
ANSWER: 1

Tweet: "The United States carries a special, historic obligation to help protect and defend
		these arteries of global trade and commerce. And this action falls directly in line with
		that tradition. That is clearly reflected in both our national security strategy and the
		national defense strategy. It is a key conviction of the president and it is a
		commitment that we are prepared to uphold."
ANSWER: 1

Tweet: "The administration‚Äôs desperate attempts at non-escalation have invited escalation. Their appeasement approach to the terrorists...has given them a green light to attack us, attack international shipping, and expand the war further."
ANSWER: 1

Tweet:
The Houthis have always been a terrorist organization ‚Äî the Biden administration should never have delisted them in the first place.

ANSWER: 1

Tweet: "The President‚Äôs strikes in Yemen are unconstitutional. For over a month, he

		without Congressional authorization. The White House must work with Congress
		before continuing these airstrikes in Yemen."
ANSWER: 5

Tweet: "We will see if these strikes deter Iran and its proxies from further attacks; I have my
		doubts. History teaches that only devastating retaliation will deter Iran, as when
		President Trump killed their terrorist mastermind in 2020 and President Reagan sank
		half their navy in 1988. That bold, decisive action is the opposite of what we‚Äôve seen
		from Joe Biden for three years."
ANSWER: 2

ANSWER: 3

ANSWER: 3

Tweet: "U.S. Strikes Won‚Äôt Achieve What a Gaza Cease-Fire Could in the Middle East"
ANSWER: 3

ANSWER: 3

ANSWER: 4

Tweet: "Do not spent dollars in the MiddleEast before you secured internal America affairs and economy"	   
ANSWER: 4

		Biden [administration] wants to fund war in Ukraine, control the war in Israel, arm

		This is insanely out of control!"
ANSWER: 5

Tweet: "his is where we should put party aside and stand for the oath we all took: Congress

		the Constitution."
ANSWER: 5

Tweet: "POTUS is violating Article I of the Constitution by carrying out airstrikes in Yemen
		without congressional approval. The American people are tired of endless war."
ANSWER: 5

Tweet: "The President must come to Congress for permission before going to war. Biden can not

ANSWER: 1

Tweet:
Three years ago, Joe Biden made the weak decision to remove the Houthi's terrorist designation -- another failed attempt at appeasing Iran-backed forces who chant 'Death to America.' With hostile adversaries testing American resolve, U.S. strength is essential for our national security.

You are a machine that categorizes tweets from the US Congress. Classified into the following 2 categories:

Category 0: Not Related to American Attacks on Houthis

Category 1: Related to American Attacks on Houthis
Classify the tweet as Category 1 if it discusses, references, or provides information about the American and allied airstrikes targeting Houthi positions in Yemen. This includes tweets that mention the attacks, the targets, the military operations, or the ongoing conflict between the US/allies and the Houthis.
The key factors to look for are explicit mentions of the American attacks, the Houthis as the target, and the location of Yemen.
